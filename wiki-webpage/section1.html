        <p>Some researchers frame free will not as a metaphysical absolute, but as a perception. A psychological experience consists of two main components:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sense of willing</strong>  - the feeling that oneself initiates or causes an action.</li>
                <li><strong>Sense of self-agency</strong> - the sense that oneself is the only one who controls or authorizes the action.</li>    
            </ul>
        At its core, free will is about agency: the capacity to act according to oneâ€™s own intentions and desires. However, this sense of control has been challenged 
        by discoveries in neuroscience and psychology, which suggest that our brains may make decisions before we are consciously aware of them.</p>
