# The *Illusion* Or *Disillusion* of Free Will

Everyone would like to think that we are fully responsible about the choices we make. *Do I make pancakes or waffles for breakfast? Do I get up in the morning or stay in bed?* One would like to think that we have free will to pick our own path, to make our own decisions for our lives. But what if the idea of free will is just an illusion? This is something experts across many fields have debated, whether freedom truly exist or if its merely an illusion created by us to give our lives meaning. 


## What is Free Will
Some researchers frame free will not as a metaphysical absolute, but as a perception. A psychological experience consists of two main components:
1. **Sense of willing** - the feeling that oneself initiates or causes an action.
2. **Sense of self-agency** - the sense that oneself is the only one who controls or authorizes the action.

At its core, free will is about agency: the capacity to act according to one’s own intentions and desires. However, this sense of control has been challenged by discoveries in neuroscience and psychology, which suggest that our brains may make decisions before we are consciously aware of them.


## The Classical View
Philosophers like Aristotle argued that moral responsibility depends on free will. Without it, holding people accountable for their actions would make little sense. This traditional view sees free will as essential to ethics, law, and human dignity.

## Philosophical Perspectives
Philosophers today tend to fall into three main camps:

### Libertarians
The belief that free will is incompatible with determinism, and agents have free will. They, therefore, reject determinism.

### Determinism
Argue that every choice is caused by prior events and natural laws—making free will impossible.

### Compatibilists
Take a middle ground, suggesting that free will and determinism can coexist if we redefine “freedom” as acting according to one’s motives without external coercion.

## Why it matters
Whether free will is real or not affects how we view responsibility, justice, and even personal identity. If our actions are determined by factors beyond our control, how should society judge wrongdoing or praise success? Understanding the illusion or disillusion of free will forces us to rethink what it means to be human in an age where science increasingly explains our behavior.
